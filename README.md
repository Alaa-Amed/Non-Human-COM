# __Non-human Communication__

## Project Overview

Plants are a vital part of our ecosystem as they release oxygen into the air, store carbon by pulling it from the air, not to mention they can play an essential part of our psychological and physical wellness. Despite all the positive impact that plants have on our lives, research shows that plants are a species that is not as cared about by humans as we ought to be. In fact, our lack of care for plants is characterized as __Plant blindness__, which is a form of cognitive bias about human tendency to ignore plant species.

In an effort to combat this phenomenon, I wanted to explore an area of communication known as __Interspecies Communication (IC)__. IC can be defined as the interchange or transmission of thoughts, opinions, or information by speech with members of another species. The reason I wanted to explore IC is to see if communicating with a different species could increase empathy towards them.

Based on the research I've conducted on the topic of IC, in the form of semi-structured interviews, most participants believed that if they:
> could have a way of communicating with plants, it may lead to [them] being better at taking care of them.

## Plant-Human Communication
The goal for this project was to create a system with which plants and humans can develop a meaningful relationship. The way I envisioned IC is by giving plants feelings, thoughts, a personality, and an overall sense of autonomy. I wanted to do that by implementing an "organic" speech generator for the plant in question so that they could express themselves, however that proved difficult to achieve. So, instead I decided to abstract the communication by outputting interactive art that is altered by plant state.

## The Build
The project consists of two main components, the plant & the visual output.
