In an effort to combat this phenomenon, I wanted to explore an area of communication known as __Interspecies Communication (IC)__. IC can be defined as the interchange or transmission of thoughts, opinions, or information by speech with members of another species.

The way I envisioned IC is by giving plants feelings, thoughts, a personality, and an overall sense of autonomy. The goals for this project was
